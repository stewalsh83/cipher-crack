Assignment info:
    Caesar Cipher or Substitution Cipher
    Decrypt gitlab files (well designed and commented code)
    see if you can make any improvements in the speed
    time it see how long it takes to crack code (report it)

Code:
    INPUT:
        your program should take a text file as input
        It should analyse that file.
    
    OUTPUT:
        two files as its output
        file output name - filename-decrypted.txt (print filename %s-decrypted.txt)
        key file         - filename-key.txt
        Key file should take the form 
        letter = cipher-letter
        i.e  A = D

Files:
    - the cipher text for all files = two-cities-caesar-cipher.txt
    - The plain text for all files  = two-cities.txt
    - The key for all files         = two-cities-caesar-key.txt


Report:
    Write a report (900-1000 word report)
    Using my files section

Read:
    The Codebook by Simon Singh

Start:
    write program that can read and write txt files.
